          <p>My name is Ryan Grady, and I want to pursue an exciting career in full stack web development.  Iâ€™m choosing this career path because I have always been interested in how software can be used to make the world a better place, and I have just finished a six-month coding bootcamp at the University of Arizona where I absolutely fell in love with software development.  Over the past six months I went to class three days a week, spent 10 to 15 hours of additional time on homework and group projects per week, and I learned more than I could have ever anticipated when I enrolled into the program.  I did this all while holding down a full time job as an electrical engineer at Raytheon, because I believe that the combination of hard work and determination is the best way to achieve your goals. </p>

          <p>In my coding bootcamp class I got to learn all about client side and server side software, with an emphasis in the MERN (Mongo Express React Node) stack.  On the client side I learned how to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create functional web pages, and how to utilize tools like Bootstrap and jQuery when appropriate to make those web pages even better.  I also learned how to use the React library to make websites that are lightning fast, and how to use API calls to dynamically display external information on any website that I create.  On the server side I learned how to write a server in Express and Node, how to create functional databases in both SQL and Mongo DB, how to use Passport.js to authenticate users, and how to use tools like mysql and mongoose to integrate the Express server software with databases.  I got the chance to work on two full stack group projects where I got to utilize all these tools to create two amazing websites, which can be viewed in my portfolio.</p>

          <p>I am also a University of Arizona Alumni, with a degree in Systems Engineering with a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  While in college I learned a ton about everything involving math, circuits, and problem solving, while getting the chance to work alongside some of the brightest people in the great state of Arizona.  I also got the opportunity to work as a desk manager, where I learned what it takes to manage a staff and create a work environment where everyone felt comfortable showing up and bringing their full selves to work.  I volunteered at some of the local high schools and middle schools where I got to teach kids about math and science, with the highlight being when I got to help the MESA (Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement) team from Amphitheater High School complete in the big annual MESA competition in Phoenix, Arizona.  I want to contribute to small and medium businesses to help them succeed, and I am one solid opportunity from starting my career as a professional web developer.</p>
        
        <p>I am incredibly excited to get started, if you would like to contact me please head over to the "contact" section of this website (in the top right).   I look forward to hearing of any opportunities that might be a good fit for me.</p>
